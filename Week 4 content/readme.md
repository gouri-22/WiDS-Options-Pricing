## WEEK 4
The major Task for this is reading this [research paper](https://github.com/Amish462004/Blackoptions-price/blob/main/Week%204%20Content/Option%20Pricing%20with%20deep%20Learning.pdf) research paper and build an MLP1 model. That is the basic requirement for being eligible for the certificate. You can also make MLP2 and LSTM model if you have time and want to explore, but this is not a hard requirement from our side.

You will be using the AsianPaints data-set that has been provided.

You can follow [this](https://github.com/ycm/cs230-proj) for more details.
