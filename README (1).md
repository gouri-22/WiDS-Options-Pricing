## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a data visualization library and 2-D plotting library of Python.It is a close resemblance to MATLAB embedded in Python programming language.
Histogram, bar plots, scatter plots, area plot to pie plot, Matplotlib can depict a wide range of visualizations. With a bit of effort and tint of visualization capabilities, with Matplotlib, you can create just any visualizations.
Matplotlib also facilitates labels, grids, legends, and some more formatting entities with Matplotlib. Basically, everything that can be drawn!

### Installation of Matplotlib
For installation you can refer [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_getting_started.asp)
Once you are done with the installation part , you can use it by importing it in your applications by adding **import** keyword.

### Getting Started With Matplotlib

Check this [notebook](https://github.com/Amish462004/Blackoptions-price/blob/main/Week%202%20Content/Matplotlib.ipynb) to get basic knowledge of Pandas .Relevant links to websites and documentations have been provided in the notebook itself.

## Plotly
Plotly is a versatile and interactive data visualization library that enables users to create interactive plots and charts. It supports various programming languages, including Python, R, and JavaScript, making it accessible for a wide range of users. Plotly offers a powerful and user-friendly toolset for creating compelling and interactive data visualizations. 

### Installation of Plotly
check out [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-plotly-tutorial/#Installation) for installation guidelines.
Similar to Matplotlib, after installing, you should be able to use it by the help of **import** keyword.

### Getting Started with Plotly
For the sake of this project we do not need much knowledge of Plotly library, but we just added this to the course so as to give you a brief understanding of how data visualization can be made interactive which is an essential tool for your journey ahead in data science.
Please refer this [documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kanncaa1/plotly-tutorial-for-beginners) for understanding plotly in detail.
