The Week 3 material may appear a bit descriptive and daunting at first, but it becomes manageable through substantial practice. While it might seem challenging to master everything in just a week, the goal is to focus on understanding the basics, and that’s all you need to start building this options pricing model.

Assuming you’re already familiar with logistic and linear regression, the next step is to understand neurons and neural networks. A great starting point is the [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) series, which makes these concepts easy to visualize.

For more in-depth learning, you can check out courses like [codebasics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7CxAacxVndI4bE_o3BDtO&si=u9QP0ToIJ8g2DT-7) or [MIT Lecture](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI&si=eJaVT41ls8D08PtV) Series. These are fantastic resources that explain things clearly.

To stay on track with machine learning in the long term, try to keep practicing regularly. Andrew Ng’s courses on Coursera are excellent; you can audit them for free or apply for financial aid if needed.

For the Black-Scholes Equation, start with [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp#:~:text=The%20Black%2DScholes%20model%2C%20aka,free%20rate%2C%20and%20the%20volatility) or the Varsity Module (Chapter 21). You might come across some additional terms or concepts like options Greeks- don’t worry, these are covered in the same resources. If you’re curious, you can also look into the derivation of the Black-Scholes Equation. However, it’s not something you need to stress about right now.
